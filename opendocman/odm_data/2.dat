Epiware v4.8.5

* Run the "install" script.
* It checks to see of your are super user right now



* For new installs no longer have to create directory /usr/share/antiword
* For shared hosted installs now create the document area
* and binary area off of your /home/myaccount dir

* You can install manually... 

mkdir /home/myaccount/storage
mkdir /home/myaccount/storage/document_area
mkdir /home/myaccount/storage/binaries

cp -r  Epiware_4.8.5/binaries/*  /home/myaccount/storage/binaries
chmod -R 777 /home/myaccount/storage

* The issues will be applying permissions so that apache
* can write to this directory as well as execute programes
* Will all depend on your hosted service..
* apache process might be owned by nobody or apache..
* You will need to change accordingly

chown -R nobody /storage
chmod -R 711 /storage
chmod -R +x /storage/binaries

OR.. 
chmod -R 777 /storage

* next update the config.inc.php file..
* to point to these new locations.

  define("BINARY_LOCATION", "/home/myaccount/storage/binaries");

  define("DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY","/home/myaccount/storage/document_area");   
  define("CALENDAR_ATTACHMENT_DIRECTORY","/home/myaccount/storage/attachments");
  define("IMAGE_GALLERY_PATH","/home/myaccount/storage/document_area");
  define("ERROR_LOG_PATH", "/home/myaccount/storage/document_area");
  define("EPI_BANNER_DIRECTORY","/home/myaccount/storage/document_area");

* You must issue following table into your database

CREATE TABLE `token` (
  `token_id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `token_data` char(64) NOT NULL,
  `num_of_uses` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  `time_of_death` datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  `user_id` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  `group_id` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  `time_created` datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',

cp -r Epiware_4.8.0/epi  /var/www/html/epi_new

cp /var/www/html/epi/config.inc.php /var/www/html/epi_new
cp /var/www/html/epi/index.php /var/www/html/epi_new

Then test the new release 
www.mycompany.com/epi_new

Once looks good.. make back up of old and
mv epi_new epi












Installation
============

Download and install the lastest MySQL          http://www.mysql.com
Download and install the lastest APACE          http://www.apache.org
Download and install the lastest PHP            http://www.php.net


Unzip and untar the file Epiware-***.tar.gz     tar xvfz Epiware-***.tar.gz
Change into the Epiware-*** directory           cd Epiware*
Login as root                                   su
Run the install script                          ./install


Install does 3 important steps.
1. Create a dir called /storage/document_area
2. Copies binaries to /storage/binaries
3. Copies share/antiword to /usr/share/antiword

You can change the location /storage/document_area.
If you change this location, you must 
tell the application to look in this new location 
in the config.inc.php.
You will need to update each of the folowing, to where 
documents will be stored, if different.

  define("DOCUMENT_DIRECTORY","/storage/document_area"); 
  define("CALENDAR_ATTACHMENT_DIRECTORY","/storage/attachments");
  define("IMAGE_GALLERY_PATH","/storage/document_area");
  define("ERROR_LOG_PATH", "/storage/document_area");
  //a document area for wiki-group banners - unlike document area, this cannot be changed w/o moving all files at a later date
  define("EPI_BANNER_DIRECTORY","/storage/document_area");


Likewise if you change the location of the binaries you will also
need to update the config.inc.php variable

   define("BINARY_LOCATION", "/storage/binaries");


Make sure you chance this to anything other than what is delivered.
This makes the encryption on your URL unique
  
  define("KEY", "my_unique_key_example");

EPIware should not be running on your machine.


 
You can remove the EPIware installation directory.


NOTES:
- The first person that logs into Epiware 
  will be the ROOT user.  He has full control of the applicaiton.
  Other users can also be designated as root after they are created.
   
- By default, php expects to find the mysql.sock file at /tmp/mysql.sock
  If your mysql.sock file is located in another directory, you will have 
  to edit the EPIware configuration file (./config.inc.php).
  Edit the line that contains 'define( "IP_ADDRESS","localhost");' to
  'define( "IP_ADDRESS","localhost:/path/to/mysql.sock");' where
  /path/to/mysql.sock is the complete path to your mysql.sock file.
